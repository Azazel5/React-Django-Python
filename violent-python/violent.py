# Buffer overflow attacks

# These work by overwriting the next pointers of user input fields. Some essential aspects of a stack based
# buffer overflow attack:
# 1. Overflow: input which exceeds he expected value in the stack
# 2. Return address: 4 byte address used to jump directly on top of the stack
# 3. Padding: A series of NOP (no operation) instructions, which allows the attacker to guesstimate the
#    next address to jump on.
# 4. Shellcode: a piece of code written in Assembly, which can be generated from MetaSpoit

# The idea is to connect to a port using sockets, authenticate to the host, and then send in the crash
# variable.

# To recap, you must get the pcap (hehe) file and pass it into the pcap_main function. Pcap
# is a capture of network activity, which can be done by the pypcap library. However, this
# library has bad documentation, so I decided to use the scapy library which I'd heard about.
# Using the sniff method, I downloaded all source and destination packets into a pcap file and
# passed it to the functions above which showed a list of packets being sent from my IP to
# whatever server of the website I was visiting during the sniff session. If the city wasn't
# listed in the maxmind database, it is listed as unregistered, otherwise it spits out the
# city and country of the server; since there is a lot of packets being sent to and fro
# my computer to servers, some IPs get repeated. For eg. 1.1.1.1 -> 2.2.2.2 and then
# 2.2.2.2 -> 1.1.1.1 i.e. the src and dest get switched on each request and response
# cycle (from what I understand).
