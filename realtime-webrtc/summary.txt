Introduction
------------

The point of developing nd using WebRTC is for browsers to exchange real-time data peer-to-peer.
Classically speaking, the web works in a client-server model i.e. requesting the server and 
the server sending back a response. WebRTC takes this further by making it peer-to-peer.
PeerConnections allow data to flow freely in between browsers without intermediary servers.
   
    "The most common WebRTC scenario is likely to be the one where both browsers are
    running the same web application, downloaded from the same web page. In this case
    the Trapezoid becomes a Triangle"

NAT devices at the end of the NAT network makes sure that depleted IPv4 addresses can be 
reused.

            HTTP                WebRTC API 
Web Server ------> JS/HTML/CSS ------------> Browser 

Let's think of a video + audio call in between two browsers. This involves:
    1. Caller browser, Caller JS application, Web server
    2. Callee JS application, Callee Browser 

WebRTC API builds around three main classes: MediaStream, PeerConnection, and DataChannel.

A MediaStream is a stream of audio or video. LocalMediaStream represents a stream recorded
from a local device such as a microphone or webcam. To create that, the app must ask permission
from the user via the getUserMedia function.

A PeerConnection is, as the name suggests, a connection between peer browsers. The other remote
peer usually runs an instance of the same JS application (but the language of the book suggests
that this need not be the case always). Connections are coordinated via signaling chanels in the 
web server through XMLHttpRequest or sockets.

Bonus: what is STUN and TURN? STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) allows the app to locate 
NAT on the network. Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) helps the app locate IPs and ports.
This PeerConnection uses ICE protocol with STUN and TURN to allow data to UDP pass through 
firewalls and stuff. Therefore, using these APIs are a great way to share data remotely, bypassing
the need for servers and stuff.

DataChannel allows browsers to send bi-directional data.

Basic steps for a simple WebRTC applicatioon:

1. Ram and Shyam connect to a web server containing the application
2. Ram starts a call, which creates a PeerConnection object. Then the calling side sets UDP
   a MediaStream. Then a signaling message is created with ICE candidates with a fingerprint 
   and sent to the server.
3. The server processes this, determines the person who's being called AKA Shyam, and sends 
   a signal to Shyam, who answers the call; in doing so, his JS creates a PeerConnection, and 
   everything in steps 2. and 3. are repeated, ending with a fingerprint being sent back to 
   Ram.

Handling Media in the Browser
-----------------------------

Media tracks can contain many other channels, such as one video + two audio (for left and right).
The createObjectUrl() function tells the browser to create a media blob which the book talks about,
and it's needed for both local and remote streams.

If the success callback is fired, the function is passed a media stream, which can be set to the 
window (made available in the console)/video element and played.

VVIMP: Browsers provide a media pipeline from sources to sinks. Sinks are img, vid, etc tags, and 
sources can be webcams, microphones, or FILES ON THE USER's HARD DRIVE. The WebRTC constraints 
API also allows developers to control the video height/width/aspect ratios etc. 


Building the Browser RTC Trapezoid: A Local Perspective
-------------------------------------------------------

The signaling channel needs to support the exchange of three kinds of information, namely:
Media session management, Nodes' network information, and Nodes' multimedia capabilities.
In this chapter, we will not focus on this and create two different peers in a single machine.
If you wanna see how to do the same in different peers from different machines, stay tuned for
the next chapter.

You can also add data channels to PeerConnections, allowing for bi-directional data exchange.
You can take a look at the code either in the JS files or in the book, but the concept, after 
creating RTCConnections, is the same: join the data channel/media to the PeerConnection and 
register event handlers for when the data is ready on the local side and the remote side, 
handle errors, and perform all house keeping such as disabling/enabling buttons etc.

You have to define the data channel onclose and onopen handlers after making the DataChannel.
And you must also specify a remote data channel receieved handler. This callback occurs 
after the createOffer function call. An answer is created in the gotLocalDescription function 

The Need for a Signaling Channel
--------------------------------

Signaling is required to exchange session and network based information. We will create a
full-stack app involving two clients and a server to showcase an actual PeerConnection.
There are three different actors in this app: a channel initiator, a signaling server, and 
a channel join. A channel is created upon a specific request from the initiator to the server, 
which creates the channel, and messages can begin after the second peer joins.

Putting It All Together: Your First WebRTC System from Scratch
--------------------------------------------------------------

We're going to create a full fledged WebRTC system now, which will be very crucial for your 
application's development. Here's a list of steps used in a full WebRTC app:

    1. Initiator connects to the server, which then creates the signaling channel 
    2. Initiator asks the user for permission and gets media
    3. Joiner connects to the server and joins the channel
    4. Joiner gets access to local media and the server sends the initiator a message 
       
       4.1. Initiator creates PeerConnection, adds local stream, creates SDP offer, and 
       sends it to the remote peer 

       4.2. After receiving the offer, the joiner also creates the PeerConnection, adds its 
       media feed, and sends the SDP answer to its remote party

    5. During this, the two peers send network reachability info through the signaling mechanism
    6. When the initiator receives its offer answer from the other peer, and also uses the 
    DataChannel to easily exchange information.
