I want you to write a Python script which scrapes through all the followers of an Instagram page, 
then analyse all the verified pages followed by those followers and gives us the list of common verified
pages for all the followers.
Example : Input Account : Nike | Firstly Our script goes through the profile of all the followers of Nike
and collects data about what other verified brands they follow. Example - Puma, Adidas, etc.
Once this is done, we need data about common brands for all followers of Nike.
If you have any questions, let me know.
