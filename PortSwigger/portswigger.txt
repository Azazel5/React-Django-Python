SQL INJECTIONS
--------------

Inj.1 - Retriving hidden data
.............................

- Assuming a website with URL: https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts'--
This results in a particular SQL query: SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts'--' AND released = 1

- What exactly is the '--'?
A -- is an SQL comment. Anything after this in a query is not applied.
We can also view products in categories that the attacker doesn't know about AKA

https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts' + OR + 1=1--

This will return all items.

Inj.2 - Subverting application logic
....................................

- If an app uses a SQL where query to check for username and password, 
an attacker can inject a '--' after the username check to ignore the
password check. 

Inj.3 - Retriving data from other database tables
.................................................

- Never return an SQL query as an application response because this lets
attackers use the UNION keyword i.e. an additional SQL query.

query: SELECT name, description FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts'
injection: ' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--

First order injection = application takes user input for HTTP request and processes the input as SQL statement and executes it
Second order injection = application takes user input for HTTP request but stores it in a DB. While performing a different
request, the original is taken from the DB and is executed. 

Authentication
--------------

- Remember, the host parameter in the web is the request originator. 
- Always return the same status code for an incorrect username/password combination. Some websites return a different status
code for one, which will lead the attacker to believe one was correct. Same with error messages and response times (tricky eh?)
