OWASP ZAP
---------

- Tons and tons of tools available here, we'll be taking a look at em one by one

Quick scan - as the name says
Manual scan - lets you open a browser and manually explore vulnerabilites. If you enable HUD (heads up display),
it becomes even more powerful.

- If the HUD frames hide a lot of information, press the green button to hide it
- The history/Web sockets keeps a record of all requests/responses made in the website. Also, you can change
the payloads for the request and re-send it, just like Firefox. The sites tool makes it easy to see which
particular pages made the HTTP requests and the history tab is conveniently opened on click.

- Using the 'break' utility, you can change requests on the fly i.e. intercept it, change the payload/headers,
send it again. Useful when the frontend validations disable some values but there's no server side checks.

Active scan: enable after looking through the application thoroughly
Attack mode: helpful to be run before looking through the application

Passive scan is completely safe as it only checks the requests and responses. Active scan uses attacks.
It also produces reports on problems found and how to solve them

- There are also ZAP extensions!! It can scan ports as well.
- OWASP ZAP can also automate these security tests, which is good because security needs to be present in each
stage of the software development lifecycle, just like QA testing. 

Awesome way: run Selenium tests but proxy them through ZAP!

- "Context is a bunch of URL regexes which define which URLs are to be included or excluded". Added to score by default.

- There's a scripts tab which lets you write scripts regarding a lot of things, check it out! It has a bunch of scripts
available by default. Inbuilt support for JS, Python, or Ruby.
