OWASP ZAP
---------

- Tons and tons of tools available here, we'll be taking a look at em one by one

Quick scan - as the name says
Manual scan - lets you open a browser and manually explore vulnerabilites. If you enable HUD (heads up display),
it becomes even more powerful.

- If the HUD frames hide a lot of information, press the green button to hide it
- The history/Web sockets keeps a record of all requests/responses made in the website. Also, you can change
the payloads for the request and re-send it, just like Firefox. The sites tool makes it easy to see which
particular pages made the HTTP requests and the history tab is conveniently opened on click.

- Using the 'break' utility, you can change requests on the fly i.e. intercept it, change the payload/headers,
send it again. Useful when the frontend validations disable some values but there's no server side checks.

Active scan: enable after looking through the application thoroughly
Attack mode: helpful to be run before looking through the application
