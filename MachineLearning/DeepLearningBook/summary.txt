We are trying to measure and understand the factors of variance of
features through ML algorithms, some of which may be obvious to humans
but tough to understand for machines i.e. a person's accent to determine
where they're from for instance. Deep learning combines several simpler
elements together to form a deeper understanding of the entity. 

Now the book goes on to describe (in brief) a history of how the field
of deep learning emerged, dipped, and rose back, through the story of
multi-layer perceptrons, the inability to solve XOR, and back to its
popularity today, thanks to increasing computational ability of machines,
GPUs, and such.

At this point, the books provides a review of mathematical concepts required
to understand deep learning. After this, we're good to go to learn this field!
