/* 
 * Writing a mixin for media queries is pretty useful and follows the DRY principle

 * 0 - 600px: phone
 * 600 - 900px: tablet portrait
 * 900 - 1200px: tablet landscape
 * 1200 - 1800px: desktop 
 * 1800+: big desktop

 * @content allows us to pass any content to a mixin
 * you can use @if directive to make it work like an if statement in programming 
 * $breakpoint can be phone, tab-port, tab-land, big-desktop
 * Note - ems and rems don't matter in relation to media queries, so using ems is good

 * A good order towards "responsifying" your website can be:
 * base > typography > general layout > grid > specific page layouts > components
