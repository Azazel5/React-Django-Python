/* Make animations smoother and more real i.e. how far away it is 
 * from the user. The child element i.e. &__side gets the view, not the parent.
 * Need backface-visibility to hide the back value, as the front and back has 
 * different colors, but they're still stacked on top of each other.
 * Height collapse is a common problem in floating (clearfix), but it can 
 * happen in position: absolute as well. In the case of abs, just specify the 
 * height of parent and child as equal, and that should be it.
