We need to develop a Chatbot for our Whatsapp Business. I'm sharing the main idea but we can make it simpler at the beginning.
> Users start the convesrasation. The only path that we want to recognize is if the client write a) text 1 b) text 2 - so we give only 2 possibility that we can recognize. Like: Hello or Ciao
> Our chatbot answer and show the photo of the product. He can choose between 2
> Client choose which product he want
> Our Chatbot ask how many and if the want someting more
> When client confirm we need to ask:
>> Name and Surname for the shipping
>> Shipping address
>> Type of delivery
>> When he want the order
>> If he want to write a Gift message
>>> From here we can process manually the order.

> If it's possible should be great if:
>> we can send the link to make the payment by paypal pro
>> create order inside magento 1.9
* I can consider also this second part on the basis of time and cost.
