We're trying to add stripe connect to pay users in a marketplace built on Django.
This should be a reasonably quick project, we're just looking to hand our Django website off to someone
with experience setting up StripeConnect so we can make sure we are doing the oauth link and other good
security practices correctly.

Try connecting to oath in this app!
