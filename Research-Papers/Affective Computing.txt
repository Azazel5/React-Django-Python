This paper attempts to discuss affective computive from the perspective of emotions. Given how important
emotions are to humans, it should be no surprise that these intelligent systems should be able to 
understand emotions to some degree.  This is not to say that computers should actually have emotions 
because that would be a disaster. The author is pushing for computing which arises from, or influences 
emotions. The author gives a great example of how emotionally voltile people can be, particularly in 
relation to one's behavior to the other. My own example would be: 
    if you keep getting interrupted while speaking by the same guy, and it happens again for the 
    third time, your reaction will be dependent on whether the guy apologizes this time (at the 
    very least) or just carries on nonchalantly. For the former case, you may call out the guy in 
    a fit of anger and in the latter case, you may be a little more forgiving.
