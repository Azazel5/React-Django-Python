The goal of this project is to create an image server that provides a REST API for
• Creating new users (each user should have a unique id and a name).
• Listing the users in the system.
• Uploading .jpg images to a user's online storage space (each image should have a unique key
and a title).
• Listing the available images by user id.
• Obtaining the images from the server.
• The API should be developed in such a way as to support Hypermedia.
• The image server's REST API supports OAuth to allow third party applications to
access a user's images.
